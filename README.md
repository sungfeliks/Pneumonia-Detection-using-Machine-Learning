# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Leveraging machine learning for early pneumonia detection. This Master's capstone project compares SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models using a labeled Kaggle dataset. Models were evaluated via accuracy, log loss, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to assess diagnostic potential and support timely medical intervention.
